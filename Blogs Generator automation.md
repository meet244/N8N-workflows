# ü§ñ AI On-Brand Article Generator (n8n Flow)

<img width="100%" alt="n8n-ai-blog-writer-flow-diagram" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff12ab9e-b595-440e-bcc7-dd3969182559" />

This project is a sophisticated content generation pipeline, built in **n8n**, that functions as an AI-powered ghostwriter. The workflow automatically scrapes and analyzes existing articles from a blog to learn its unique **structure, writing style, and brand voice**. It then uses these insights to generate entirely new, on-brand articles and saves them as drafts in **WordPress** for human review.

This automation is perfect for content teams looking to scale their output while maintaining a high degree of brand consistency across all published materials.

-----

## üßæ Output Sample

The workflow produces a complete, well-structured article draft in WordPress, ready for a final human touch before publishing.

> #### **New Draft Created in WordPress**
>
> **Title:** A Guide to AI-Powered Document Classification
>
> **Body:**
> In today's data-driven world, businesses are drowning in documents. From invoices and contracts to customer feedback and reports, managing this influx of information is a monumental task. Traditional methods are slow, error-prone, and simply can't keep up. This is where AI-powered document classification and extraction come in, offering a transformative solution.

> **Why Vision Models Outperform Traditional OCR**
>
> For years, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) was the go-to for digitizing documents. However, it often struggles with complex layouts, varied fonts, and imperfect scans. Modern vision models...

## üìå Features

  * üîé **Scrapes Existing Content**: Automatically fetches the latest articles from any target blog to use as a style reference.
  * üß† **Dual AI Analysis**: Uses **Google Gemini** to perform two distinct analyses:
      * One AI call identifies the **structural and stylistic patterns** of the content.
      * Another call extracts the **brand voice characteristics**, tone, and specific language choices.
  * ‚úçÔ∏è **On-Brand Content Generation**: Combines the style and voice analyses to create a detailed "master prompt" for generating new articles.
  * üìù **HTML to Markdown Conversion**: Cleans and converts raw HTML into Markdown for more efficient and accurate processing by the AI.
  * üíæ **Seamless WordPress Integration**: Automatically saves the final, AI-written article as a draft in your WordPress site.
  * üîÑ **Adaptable & Reusable**: Can be adapted to use other sources like PDFs or internal documents as the knowledge base.

-----

## üß© Flow Breakdown

### 1\. **Import Existing Content**

  * The workflow is triggered and begins by scraping the five latest articles from a specified blog (in this case, `blog.n8n.io`).
  * It extracts the URL for each article and then fetches the full HTML content of each page.

-----

### 2\. **Convert HTML to Markdown**

  * The raw HTML of each article's body is extracted and converted into clean **Markdown**. This optimizes the content for the AI, reducing token usage and preserving the essential structure.

-----

### 3\. **AI-Powered Style & Voice Analysis**

  * The Markdown content of all five articles is sent to **Google Gemini** in two parallel steps:
      * **Analyze Structure & Writing Style**: The first AI model is prompted to describe the common structure, layout, and writing style of the articles as a whole.
      * **Extract Brand Voice**: The second AI model is tasked with identifying and defining the specific "brand voice" characteristics, providing examples of tone and language from the text.

-----

### 4\. **Generate New On-Brand Article**

  * The analyses from the previous two steps are combined with a new article instruction (e.g., "Write a guide on AI for document classification").
  * This comprehensive brief is sent to a final **Google Gemini** model, which acts as a blog writer, using the provided guidelines to draft a completely new article that matches the brand's style and voice.

-----

### 5\. **Save Draft to WordPress**

  * The title and body of the newly generated article are sent to **WordPress** via its API.
  * The article is saved as a **draft**, allowing a human editor to review, validate, and schedule it for publishing.

-----

## üõ†Ô∏è APIs & Services Used

| Service | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **n8n HTTP Request** | Scrapes the initial blog content from the web. |
| **Google Gemini API** | Performs all AI analysis and content generation tasks. |
| **WordPress API**| Creates a new draft post with the AI-generated content. |
| **Google Docs API**| (Optional) Saves the generated article to a Google Doc. |

-----

## üöÄ Use Cases

  * üìà **Scale Content Marketing**: Rapidly increase the volume of blog posts without sacrificing brand consistency.
  * üí° **Generate First Drafts**: Provide your content writers with high-quality, on-brand first drafts, significantly speeding up their workflow.
  * üëî **Onboard New Writers**: Use the AI-generated style guide to quickly train new writers on your brand's voice and tone.
  * üîÑ **Content Repurposing**: Feed the workflow with transcripts or documents to automatically convert them into blog-style articles.

-----

## üß† AI Analysis & Generation Prompts

The workflow uses a multi-step prompting strategy to achieve its on-brand output:

> **1. Style Analysis Prompt:**
> "Given the following...articles..., describe how best one could replicate the common structure, layout, language and writing styles of all as aggregate."
>
> **2. Brand Voice Prompt:**
> "Using the given content...extract all voice characteristics from it along with description and examples demonstrating it."
>
> **3. Final Generation Prompt:**
> "You are a blog content writer who writes using the following article guidelines... Write a content piece as requested by the user... Here are the brand voice characteristic and examples you must adopt..."
