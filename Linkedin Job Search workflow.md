<img width="100%" alt="flow-graph" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfd79f5f-8813-4346-95a5-fed2faf8caef" />


This project is a powerful, fully automated workflow built with **n8n** that streamlines the job search process. It automatically scrapes job listings from **LinkedIn**, uses **Google Gemini** to evaluate how well each job matches a predefined resume, generates a suitability rating and a custom cover letter, and then neatly organizes everything in a **Google Sheet**.

This workflow is designed to act as a personal **AI-powered job search assistant**, saving hours of manual work by identifying the most relevant opportunities and preparing initial application materials.

-----

## üßæ Output Sample

The final output is a neatly organized Google Sheet, where each row represents a job that has been scraped and evaluated by the AI.

| Company Name | Rating | Salary | Cover Letter Snippet |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Vijaya Enterprises | 4.3 | ‚Çπ6,50,000 | "Dear Rahat Sharma, I am excited to apply for the Graphic Designer position..." |
| Mosaic Wellness | 4.8 | (Not specified) | "With 3 years of experience in branding and digital marketing, my skills..." |
| OLIVER Agency | 4.5 | (Not specified) | "My expertise in Adobe Creative Suite and motion graphics aligns perfectly..." |

## üß© Flow Breakdown

### 1\. **Trigger: Schedule**

  * The workflow kicks off automatically at a specified time or interval (e.g., every 24 hours).

-----

### 2\. **Scrape LinkedIn Jobs**

  * An **HTTP Request** node calls the **Apify API** with a predefined LinkedIn Jobs search URL.
  * It scrapes all relevant job listings and their details, such as company name, description, and job poster info.

-----

### 3\. **Loop Through Each Job**

  * The workflow iterates through each job scraped from LinkedIn, processing them one by one.

-----

### 4\. **AI Evaluation (Gemini)**

  * For each job, a LangChain node sends the job description and the user‚Äôs resume to the **Google Gemini** model.
  * The AI is prompted to act as a career assistant, judging the job fit, evaluating salary, and generating relevant content.

-----

### 5\. **Structured Output & Storage**

  * The AI‚Äôs response is parsed into a structured JSON format, extracting fields like:
      * Company Name & Website
      * Generated Cover Letter
      * Suitability Rating (e.g., 4.3/5)
      * Estimated Salary
  * Finally, the structured data for each job is appended as a new row in a designated **Google Sheet**, creating a comprehensive job tracking dashboard.

People thought of it as those annoying pop-ups and push notifications. They just didn't see the magic of advertising done right ‚Äì the way it blends creativity, strategy, and connection to really make things happen.\n\nThat belief, that borderline obsession with advertising, that's how we roll with brands and businesses.\n\nJust look at ICICIdirect. Over the last four years, they've won more marketing awards for the cross-sell campaigns we did with them than with anyone else (okay, maybe we're exaggerating a bit, but you get the idea).\n\nThat's why we're big enough to get the job done, but small enough to really, truly care.\n\nIt's how we take those \"boring\" industries like BFSI and Tech and make their brand communication actually interesting. And that's exactly what we'll do for you if you're up for it.\n\nPlus, we've got some amazing partners ‚Äì video and audio specialists, and cutting-edge ad tech folks ‚Äì so we're ready to bring that obsessive energy to your brand, no matter where you are in the country.\n\nSo, whether you need a compelling content strategy, some fresh communication ideas, or a full-blown integrated or digital campaign, we're ready to hear your story.",
